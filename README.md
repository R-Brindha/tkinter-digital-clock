Tkinter Digital Clock 
This is a simple digital clock built using Python and Tkinter.
It displays the current:
Date (Day, Month, Year)
Time (Hour, Minute, Second) in 12-hour format with AM/PM
Day of the week(e.g. MONDAY)
The clock updates every second and uses a digital-style font and red-black theme
